    "High-speed internet access has become a key input to modern labor markets: it enables online job search and matching, remote work, access to training, and participation in digitally mediated services (e.g., gig work, online freelancing). Yet access and adoption are uneven across the United States, creating a persistent “digital divide” that often maps onto geography (rural vs. urban), income, and education. For this project, we ask whether household broadband subscription is associated with employment and earnings for U.S. adults ages 25–54, and whether the relationship differs in rural versus urban contexts after controlling for demographic and human-capital factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large body of prior research suggests that broadband can affect labor outcomes, but the direction and magnitude may depend on worker characteristics and local context. Using U.S. data from 1999–2007, Atasoy (2013) finds that broadband expansion is associated with improved labor-market outcomes, consistent with the idea that connectivity reduces frictions in job search and supports labor-force participation.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "More causal work focusing on specific subpopulations also finds meaningful effects: Dettling (2017) uses an instrumental-variables strategy based on supply-side constraints to broadband access and reports that exogenous increases in high-speed internet use raise labor force participation among married women, highlighting a plausible mechanism where internet access expands feasible work arrangements and job search at home.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond participation, broadband can also influence who benefits in the labor market. Akerman, Gaarder, and Mogstad (2015) provide evidence of “skill complementarity,” where broadband adoption improves outcomes for more-skilled workers and can disadvantage less-skilled workers—suggesting that broadband may amplify existing inequalities unless paired with complementary skills and opportunities.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research also emphasizes that the broadband–employment relationship may look different in rural areas, where infrastructure, adoption, and job opportunities differ from urban labor markets. For example, Isley (2022) studies rural U.S. counties during the early COVID-19 period and finds that both broadband availability and adoption are related to employment rates, using a two-stage least squares approach to address endogeneity.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates our rural–urban heterogeneity component: if broadband supports telework, job search, and access to wider labor markets, the payoff may be larger where geographic isolation is a bigger constraint; alternatively, if high-quality jobs and complementary skills are concentrated in urban areas, the earnings gains from broadband adoption may be larger in cities. Together, these studies justify examining (1) the overall association between household broadband subscription and employment/earnings and (2) whether that association differs across rural versus urban settings after accounting for education, age, race/ethnicity, household composition, and place-based factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, prior work highlights an important methodological challenge: broadband adoption is not randomly assigned. Households with broadband may differ systematically in income, education, occupation, and local labor conditions, all of which also affect employment and earnings. The literature therefore often emphasizes careful adjustment strategies (e.g., rich controls, fixed effects, quasi-experimental instruments, or matching) to reduce confounding and clarify interpretation.<a name=\"cite_ref-2b\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In this project, using public microdata, we will treat results primarily as associational unless we can justify a credible identification strategy.\n",
